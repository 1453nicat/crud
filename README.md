CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations that can be performed on data in a database or any persistent storage system.

Create:
This operation adds new data to the system or database. For example, adding a new student to a database.
SQL equivalent: INSERT INTO

Read:

This operation retrieves or reads existing data from the system without making any changes. For instance, fetching a list of students from a database.
SQL equivalent: SELECT

Update:

This operation modifies or updates existing data in the system. For example, updating a student's age or name.
SQL equivalent: UPDATE

Delete:

This operation removes data from the system or database. For instance, deleting a student from the database.
SQL equivalent: DELETE
